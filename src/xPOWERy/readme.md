# Computation of &nbsp; _x_<sup>_y_</sup>

## A program that takes a double x and an integer y and returns xv. You can ignore overflow and underflow.

## Test Case

### Input : 
2.5<br>
3
### Output :


##The number of multiplications is at most twice the index of y's MSB, implying an O(n) time complexity.
