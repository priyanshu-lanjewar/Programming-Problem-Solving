# COMPUTATION of  x/y

## Problem Statement :Given two positive integers, compute their quotient, using only the addition, subtraction, and shifting operators.


## Testcase
### Input :
1024<br>
2

### Output : 
512

##In essence, the program applies the grade-school division algorithm to binary numbers. With each iteration, we process an additional bit. Therefore, assuming individual shift and add operations take 0(1) time, the time complexity is 0(n).
