# Parity Of Word
### If number of 1's in given binary data is even then parity = 0
### If number of 1's in given binary data is odd then parity = 1

## Test Case 1 :

### Input : 15
### Output : 0

## Test Case 2 :

### Input : 14
### Output : 1

## Time Complexity of above Computation using Normal Algorithm is O(n), where n is word length.
## Time Complexity of above Computation using Brian Kernighan's Algorithm is O(k), where k is number of 1's in Word.
