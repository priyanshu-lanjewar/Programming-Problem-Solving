# CLOSEST INTEGER WITH THE SAME WEIGHT

## Problem Statement
### a program which takes as input a nonnegative integer x and returns a number y which is not equal to x, but has the same weight as x and their difference, | y - x\, is as small as possible. You can assume x is not 0, or all Is. For example, if x = 6, you should return 5.


## Test Case : 
### Input :
8
### Output :
4

##The time complexity is 0(n), where n is the integer width.
